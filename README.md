## Quick Start

> **Note**: The main application code is located in the `srd-grid/` directory within this repository.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)
- npm 9+ (comes with Node)  
- A modern browser (Chromium/Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
- **For AI Features**: OpenAI API key (optional but recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbaillis/oDnD.git
cd oDnD
npm install  # This will automatically install dependencies in srd-grid/ with --legacy-peer-deps
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to work directly in the srd-grid directory:

```bash
cd srd-grid
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Run (Dev)

```bash
npm run dev  # Starts the development server
```

- Open the printed local URL (default http://localhost:5173/).
- Hot-reloads on save.

Alternatively, you can work directly in the srd-grid directory:

```bash
cd srd-grid
npm run dev
```

### Full Development (Client + AI DM Server)
For AI features, start both the frontend and MCP server:

```bash
npm run dev:full  # or: cd srd-grid && npm run dev:full
```
This starts both:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173/ (with hot-reload)
- **AI DM Server**: http://localhost:3001/ (MCP server for AI features)

## Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build  # Build the application
npm run preview  # Preview the built application
```

## AI Setup

### Enable AI Dungeon Master Features
1. **Get OpenAI API Key**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Create Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cd srd-grid
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Add Your API Key** to `srd-grid/.env`:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
4. **Start Full Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

The AI features are completely optional - the tactical combat system works perfectly without them!

## Game instructions

### Goal
Move and attack with the active token to reduce the opponent to 0 HP. The game alternates turns (A then B) via the End Turn button.

### Turn flow
- Each turn provides a simple budget: one Standard action, one Move action, and one Five‚ÄëFoot Step (5 ft, no difficult terrain).
- Actions no longer auto-end your turn. Click End Turn to pass to the next combatant.

### Movement
- Click a destination square to plan and commit movement for the active token.
- 5‚Äì10‚Äì5 diagonal rule is used: first diagonal costs 5 ft, second costs 10 ft, then repeats.
- Difficult terrain doubles the cost of entering that square.
- A valid 5‚Äëft step (exactly 5 ft and not into difficult terrain) consumes the five‚Äëfoot step budget; otherwise movement consumes the Move action.
- Toggle ‚ÄúSafest path‚Äù to prefer routes that avoid threatened squares when planning.

### Attacks
- Click Attack Mode, then click the enemy to attack. Attacking consumes your Standard action.
- Touch toggle: resolves attacks against Touch AC (ignores armor, shield, and natural; keeps deflection and misc).
- Flat‚ÄëFooted toggle: removes dodge from AC and disables making Attacks of Opportunity (for demo/testing).

### Cover & Concealment
- The engine applies cover (+4 or +8) if obstacles lie between attacker and target, and concealment (20%/50%) from terrain flags where applicable.

### Attacks of Opportunity (AoO)
- Moving out of a threatened square provokes.
- Making a ranged attack while in a threatened square provokes before the attack resolves.
- In this demo, each defender can make one AoO per round.
- If Flat‚ÄëFooted is toggled on, creatures cannot make AoOs.

### UI controls (top panel)
- Safest Path: plan a route that avoids threatened squares when possible.
- End Turn: end the current turn and advance initiative/round.
- Attack Mode: switch clicks to attack the enemy instead of moving.
- Ranged: attacks are treated as ranged; ranged in melee provokes an AoO.
- Edit Terrain: click to toggle Difficult terrain; Shift+click cycles Cover for the square (0 ‚Üí +4 ‚Üí +8 ‚Üí 0).
- Touch AC: resolve attacks vs Touch AC.
- Flat‚ÄëFooted: remove dodge to AC and disable AoOs (testing aid).
- Seed + Apply: set a deterministic RNG seed; all rolls become reproducible.
- Save / Load: persist and restore grid, pawns, toggles, round/active, AoO usage, and RNG seed via localStorage.
- Reset: reset to the starting scenario.

### Character Management
- **New Character**: Click the button or press **N** to open the character creation interface with full D&D 3.5 point-buy system.
- **Character Sheet**: Press **C** to view detailed character stats, equipment, and abilities.
- **Spell Book**: Press **S** to view available spells and casting information.
- **Close UI**: Press **Escape** to close any open interface.

### AI Dungeon Master (Optional)
- **DM Chat Panel**: Click "DM" button (bottom-right) or press **Ctrl+D** to open AI assistant
- **4 AI Personalities**: Choose from Experienced Mentor, Dramatic Storyteller, Tactical Strategist, or Mysterious Guide
- **17 Specialized Tools**: AI has access to combat management, environment control, story elements, and game mechanics
- **Real-time Integration**: AI is aware of your current campaign state and can assist with gameplay

**Status Indicators**:
- üü¢ **Green**: AI configured and ready
- üü° **Orange**: Initializing connection  
- üî¥ **Red**: OpenAI API key needed (see [AI Setup](#ai-setup))

See [srd-grid/CHARACTER_CREATION.md](srd-grid/CHARACTER_CREATION.md) for detailed character creation instructions.
See [srd-grid/AI_DUNGEON_MASTER.md](srd-grid/AI_DUNGEON_MASTER.md) for complete AI setup and usage guide.

### Visuals
- Red tinted cells show threatened squares from the red token.
- HP bars render near each token; a winner banner appears when an opponent reaches 0 HP.

## Notes

- Dev server default: http://localhost:5173/
- Movement costs use the 5‚Äì10‚Äì5 diagonal rule.
- Difficult terrain doubles the entering step cost.
- Save data is stored in the browser‚Äôs localStorage under `srd-grid-save`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the page doesn‚Äôt load after `npm run dev`, ensure Node 18+ is installed and no other process is bound to port 5173.
- If TypeScript errors occur, run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are present.
- Clearing the browser‚Äôs localStorage will remove saved scenarios.
