# Interface Overlap Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Z-Index Hierarchy
Fixed the layering order to prevent UI elements from overlapping incorrectly:

- **Character Creation Modal**: z-index: 2000 (highest priority)
- **Character Sheet & Spellbook**: z-index: 1200 (modal dialogs)
- **Controls Panel & Action HUD**: z-index: 1100 (main interface)
- **Toolbar**: z-index: 1050 (secondary interface)
- **Combat Log**: z-index: 950 (background info)
- **Token Manager**: z-index: 900 (lowest priority)

### 2. Position Improvements

#### Token Manager
- Reduced max-width from 400px to 320px
- Added max-height: 400px with overflow-y: auto
- Reduced font-size from 14px to 13px for better space usage
- Lowered z-index to 900 to avoid conflicts

#### Character Sheet & Spellbook
- Changed from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed`
- Moved Character Sheet from top:10px,left:10px to top:50px,left:50px
- Moved Spellbook from top:10px,right:10px to top:50px,right:50px
- This prevents overlap with the main Controls panel

#### Combat Log
- Changed from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed`
- Reduced width from 350px to 300px
- Reduced max-height from 180px to 160px
- Added proper box-shadow for visual consistency

#### Toolbar
- Changed from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed`
- Moved from top:10px,right:10px to top:60px,right:8px
- Changed layout from horizontal to vertical to save space
- This prevents overlap with the Action HUD

### 3. Responsive Design
Added CSS media queries to handle different screen sizes:

- **≤1400px**: Controls panel max-width: 500px
- **≤1200px**: Controls panel max-width: 400px, smaller font
- **≤900px**: Compact layout with reduced spacing and font sizes

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- Added consistent box-shadow to all fixed-positioned elements
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Maintained consistent dark theme across all elements

## Current UI Layout

```
Top-Left: Controls Panel (z-index: 1100)
Top-Right: Action HUD (z-index: 1100)
Bottom-Left: Combat Log (z-index: 950)  
Bottom-Right: Token Manager (z-index: 900)

Modals:
- Character Sheet: Offset from top-left (z-index: 1200)
- Spellbook: Offset from top-right (z-index: 1200)
- Character Creation: Full-screen overlay (z-index: 2000)
```

## Testing Results
- All 39 tests passing
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Development server running successfully
- Interface properly responsive across different screen sizes

## Interface Improvements Summary
The interface now has proper hierarchy, no overlapping elements, responsive design for different screen sizes, and maintains the professional dark theme throughout all components.
