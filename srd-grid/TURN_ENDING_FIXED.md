# Monster AI Turn Ending - FIXED! üéØ

## Problem Identified
The monster AI was executing its actions (single or multi-action sequences) but not properly ending its turn afterward, causing the game to hang waiting for turn completion.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Multi-Action Sequences**: The `executeMultiAction` method was executing all tactical actions but not calling `commitEndTurn()`
2. **Turn State**: The game was waiting for an explicit turn ending signal that never came
3. **Flow Control**: The MonsterTurnManager correctly identified when actions were complete but didn't finalize the turn

## Solution Implemented

### üîß **MonsterTurnManager Fix**
Modified `executeMultiAction()` method to automatically end the turn after completing all actions in a multi-action sequence:

```typescript
console.log(`Monster ${pawnId} completed multi-action sequence`);

// Automatically end turn after completing multi-action sequence
console.log(`Monster ${pawnId} ending turn after multi-action completion`);
if (typeof (window as any).commitEndTurn === 'function') {
  (window as any).commitEndTurn();
}

return true;
```

### üéÆ **Turn Flow Behavior**

#### **Multi-Action Sequences** (Most Common)
1. AI generates tactical strategy with multiple actions (e.g., move + attack)
2. MonsterTurnManager executes each action in sequence with dramatic delays
3. **Automatically ends turn** after completing all actions
4. Game proceeds to next player/round

#### **Single Action Cases**
1. AI generates simple strategy with one action (e.g., just attack)
2. MonsterTurnManager executes the single action
3. **Fallback turn ending** triggers for single actions
4. Game proceeds to next player/round

#### **End Turn Actions**
1. AI explicitly decides to end turn (rare - usually when no valid targets)
2. MonsterTurnManager immediately calls `commitEndTurn()`
3. Game proceeds to next player/round

## Expected Behavior Now ‚úÖ

### Before (Broken):
```
[Monster AI] Executing multi-action: move + attack
[MonsterTurnManager] Action 1/2: move completed
[MonsterTurnManager] Action 2/2: attack completed  
[MonsterTurnManager] Multi-action sequence completed
[Game] ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting indefinitely for turn to end...
```

### After (Fixed):
```
[Monster AI] Executing multi-action: move + attack
[MonsterTurnManager] Action 1/2: move completed
[MonsterTurnManager] Action 2/2: attack completed  
[MonsterTurnManager] Multi-action sequence completed
[MonsterTurnManager] Monster B ending turn after multi-action completion
[Game] ‚úÖ Turn ended, proceeding to next player
```

## Technical Details

- **Automatic Turn Ending**: Multi-action sequences now automatically trigger `commitEndTurn()`
- **Preserved Functionality**: Single actions and explicit end_turn actions still work correctly
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing turn management logic remains intact
- **Proper Flow Control**: Game state advances correctly after monster actions

## Status: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

The monster AI now properly completes its turns with:
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Action Execution**: Move, attack, special abilities in tactical sequences
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Turn Ending**: No more hanging turns waiting for completion
- ‚úÖ **Proper Game Flow**: Seamless transition between monster and player turns
- ‚úÖ **Dramatic Timing**: Appropriate delays between actions for cinematic effect

**The dual-agent Monster AI system now delivers complete, properly-ending combat turns!** üé≠‚öîÔ∏è‚ú®
