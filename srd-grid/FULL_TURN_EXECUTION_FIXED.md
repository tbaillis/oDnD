# Monster AI Full Turn Execution - FIXED! üéØ

## Problem Identified
The monster was only executing single actions per turn instead of full combat turns with multiple actions (move + attack + special abilities).

## Root Cause
1. **Single Action Strategy**: The TacticalCombatAI was generating single-action strategies instead of multi-action sequences
2. **Limited Action Conversion**: The MonsterAIAgent was only returning the first action from tactical strategies 
3. **Turn Manager Loop**: The MonsterTurnManager was calling the AI repeatedly, causing the same single action to repeat

## Solution Implemented

### üß† **TacticalCombatAI Enhancements**
- **Multi-Action Strategies**: Modified `createFallbackStrategy()` to generate strategies with multiple actions
- **Offensive Strategy**: Now includes MOVE + ATTACK sequence when not in melee range
- **Defensive Strategy**: Now includes RETREAT + DEFEND sequence when too close to enemies
- **Neutral Strategy**: Now includes MOVE + OPPORTUNISTIC ATTACK sequence when tactical

### üéõÔ∏è **MonsterAIAgent Updates**
- **New Interfaces**: Added `SingleAction` interface and extended `MonsterCombatAction` with `multi_action` type
- **Action Sequence Support**: Added `actionSequence` field to handle multiple ordered actions
- **Enhanced Conversion**: Modified `convertStrategyToAction()` to handle multi-action strategies properly

### üéÆ **MonsterTurnManager Overhaul**
- **Multi-Action Execution**: Added `executeMultiAction()` method to handle action sequences
- **Sequential Processing**: Each action in sequence executes with proper delays and error handling
- **Turn Completion**: Modified `executeCompleteMonsterTurn()` to handle single AI decision that contains full turn plan
- **No More Loops**: Eliminated the problematic loop that caused repetitive single actions

## Result: Full Combat Turns! üöÄ

### Before:
```
[Turn] Action 1/3: Attack (ends turn immediately)
```

### After:
```
[Turn] AI Decision: multi_action (2 actions in sequence)
  Action 1/2: move - Move into melee range for attack
  Action 2/2: attack - Strike the primary threat
[Turn] Monster B completed multi-action sequence
```

## Tactical AI Strategy Examples

### **Offensive Strategy** (Distance > 1)
1. **MOVE**: Move adjacent to target
2. **ATTACK**: Strike the enemy
- *Result*: Full assault with positioning and damage

### **Defensive Strategy** (Too close to enemies)  
1. **MOVE**: Retreat to safer position
2. **DEFEND**: Take defensive stance
- *Result*: Strategic withdrawal with damage mitigation

### **Neutral Strategy** (Moderate distance)
1. **MOVE**: Advance to better position  
2. **ATTACK**: Opportunistic strike if in range
- *Result*: Tactical positioning with conditional damage

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// New multi-action support
interface MonsterCombatAction {
  type: 'move' | 'attack' | 'special' | 'end_turn' | 'multi_action';
  actionSequence?: SingleAction[]; // For multi-action strategies
}

// Sequential execution in MonsterTurnManager
private async executeMultiAction(pawnId, action) {
  for (const singleAction of action.actionSequence) {
    await this.executeMove/Attack/Special(pawnId, singleAction);
    await this.sleep(500); // Dramatic timing
  }
}
```

## Status: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

The monster AI now executes **complete tactical turns** with:
- **Strategic Movement**: Positioning for optimal combat advantage  
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Striking after proper positioning
- **Defensive Maneuvers**: Retreating and defending when appropriate
- **Tactical Flexibility**: Multi-action sequences adapted to battlefield conditions

**The dual-agent system now delivers full D&D combat turns with both brilliant strategy AND immersive roleplay!** üé≠‚öîÔ∏è
