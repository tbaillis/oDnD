Drop your token images here (PNG/JPG/WEBP).

This folder is scanned at build-time using Vite's import.meta.glob, so every image
you add will automatically appear in the in-game token pickers for Pawn A and Pawn B.

Notes:
- Recommended size: square-ish images. They will be scaled to the grid cell.
- Licenses: ensure you have rights to use the images. If CC BY 4.0, add entries
  in public/assets/CREDITS.md with Title, Author, and Source URL.
- Supported extensions: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp
