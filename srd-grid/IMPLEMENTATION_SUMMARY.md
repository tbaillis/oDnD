tbaillis: using these images as a guid and this description  game play takes place on a screen that displays text interactions, the names and current status of your party of characters, and a window which displays images of geography, pictures of characters or events create an implementation list to create this for a SRD 3.5 game that already has the character engine built, it just needs this interface

GitHub Copilot: I'll quickly research Gold Box-style UI conventions and the D&D 3.5e SRD status/conditions to ground the implementation list in accurate details. I'll fetch authoritative pages on Gold Box UI layout and the 3.5e SRD conditions to ground the interface spec and status indicators. I’ll lay out a complete, implementation-ready plan for a Gold Box–style UI that plugs into your existing 3.5e SRD character engine.

## scope and sources used
- Gold Box layout conventions (party list, viewport, message log, command bar) used as visual guide based on your screenshots.
- 3.5e SRD conditions and status semantics for badges/tooltips and automated messaging, drawn from the SRD Condition Summary (https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm and index https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/conditions.htm).

## high-level deliverable
A modular, skinnable interface with four primary regions:
- Viewport window (scene/images/events)
- Party panel (names + AC + HP + key conditions)
- Message log (narration, prompts, combat text)
- Command bar (contextual actions with hotkeys)

It’s engine-agnostic; hook points are defined so you can attach it to Unity/Godot/MonoGame/custom engine the same way.

## screen layout spec
Base canvas: 320×200 logical pixels (faithful to Gold Box), integer scaled to window/fullscreen (2×, 3×, 4×). Maintain pixel-perfect scaling.

- Left: ViewportWindow
  - Boxed square with decorative frame.
  - Suggested inner size: 128×128 or 160×120 (keep square-ish, pick per art).
- Right: PartyPanel
  - Column with rows for each character (up to 6 visible), showing:
    - Name (monospace cyan/cobalt like your images)
    - AC (right-aligned)
    - HP (current/max or current with color ramp)
    - Small inline condition badges (1–3 prioritized, with overflow indicator “+n”)
- Bottom: MessageLog
  - Two to three lines visible at rest; supports scrollback overlay (~200 entries).
  - Colorized text for system/combat/skill checks; supports [MORE] prompts.
- Bottom-most: CommandBar
  - Inline commands with left-to-right hotkeys:
    - COMBAT (C)  WAIT (W)  FLEE (F)  ADVANCE (A)
  - Context augments (e.g., TALK (T) USE (U) SEARCH (S), CAMP (P), VIEW (V)).

Simple wireframe (logical coords):
[ Viewport 160×120 ] [ Party 144×120 ]
[ Message log 320×56 ]
[ Commands 320×24 ]

## fonts, colors, and art
- Bitmap font: 8×8 or 8×12 monospace. Colors close to CGA/EGA homage:
  - Cyan: #00FFFF for names, Green: #00FF00 for numeric HP, White: #FFFFFF for system.
  - Use a limited palette; expose theme JSON so palettes can be swapped.
- Frames/borders as 9-slice images for Viewport/Log/Panel.
- Condition icons: 12×12 or 14×14 monochrome glyphs with color tint; tooltips on hover.

## core modules and contracts

1) UI State Store (event-driven)
- Purpose: decouple engine from UI; single source of truth for screen state.
- Events (from engine to UI):
  - PartyUpdated, CharacterUpdated(id), HPChanged(id, hp), ACChanged(id, ac)
  - ConditionApplied(id, condition, source), ConditionRemoved(id, condition)
  - MessagePushed(text, kind, priority), PromptRequested(options), PromptResolved(choice)
  - SceneChanged(imageId|tile|renderFn), EncounterStarted, EncounterEnded
  - TimeAdvanced(gameTime), LocationChanged(x,y,zone), ModeChanged(explore|menu|combat)
- Commands (from UI to engine):
  - Advance(), Wait(), Flee(), StartCombat(), Interact(target), Search(), Use(), Talk(), Camp()
  - ConfirmPrompt(choiceKey), CancelPrompt()

2) PartyPanel
- Input: Party[] from store.
- Renders rows: Name, AC, HP, Badges.
- Sorting: formation order or fixed index; highlight active character on turn.
- HP display styles:
  - Compact: “95” (current only, color: green >= 66%, yellow 33–66%, red < 33%)
  - Detailed (toggle): “95/120” or “95 (temp +10)” when temp HP present.
- Badges (priority-ordered): Dying, Unconscious, Stable, Disabled, Staggered, Prone, Stunned, Dazed, Grappling, Entangled, Fatigued/Exhausted, Invisible, Incorporeal, Flat-Footed, Energy Drained, Sickened/Nauseated, Shaken/Frightened/Panicked, Dead.
- Tooltip: hover over badge to show SRD text snippet and mechanical effect.

Data contract:
CharacterStatus {
  id: string
  name: string
  armorClass: number
  hp: { current: number; max: number; temp?: number }
  initiative?: number
  conditions: ConditionCode[]    // see mapping below
  isActiveTurn?: boolean
}

3) MessageLog
- FIFO with levels: Narration, System, Combat, Skill, Warning, Prompt.
- Inline formatting: color spans, emphasis, dice rolls (“Attack +7 vs AC 18 → 26 (hit)”).
- Paging: press SPACE/ENTER to continue on prompts; ‘L’ to open scrollback.
- Optional “fast-text” toggle and auto-advance delays (150–250 ms per chunk).

API:
pushMessage({ text, kind, color?, sticky?, requiresAck? })
prompt(options: { choices: Array<{key,label,hotkey}>, timeoutMs? })

4) ViewportWindow
- Modes:
  - Static scene image (id → atlas or individual PNG).
  - Tile/render mode (draw hallway/wilderness grid; 1st-person or top-down).
  - Cut-in portrait/event vignette (overlay).
- Simple animation support: frame list or shaderless palette cycling.
- Camera hooks for “ADVANCE” step to animate forward move (200–300 ms).

5) CommandBar
- Context-driven command set; disabled/enabled based on engine mode flags.
- Hotkeys single-letter (case-insensitive); show bracketed letter in label (C)OMBAT.
- Mouse: click areas on labels; keyboard-first primary UX.

6) Input mapping
- Global:
  - Arrow keys/WSAD for facing/movement (engine decides legal moves).
  - C/W/F/A/T/U/S/V/P as above; Enter = confirm; Esc = cancel/back.
  - ‘L’ log, ‘?’ help overlay, Tab cycle targets, 1–6 select party member.
- During prompts: only listed hotkeys and Enter/Esc.

7) Condition mapping (3.5e SRD)
Shown as short codes with tooltip; suggested glyphs in parentheses.

Core set and short codes:
- DEAD (skull) → Dead
- DYG (blood drop) → Dying
- STBL (bandage) → Stable
- DIS (heart 0) → Disabled
- UNC (zzz) → Unconscious
- STAG (wavy steps) → Staggered
- PRN (down arrow) → Prone
- STUN (stars) → Stunned
- DAZ (spiral) → Dazed
- FTF (boot) → Flat-Footed
- GRP (chain) → Grappling / PIN (pin) → Pinned
- ENT (net) → Entangled
- FAT (coffee) / EXH (coffee ×) → Fatigued / Exhausted
- INV (dotted outline) → Invisible
- INC (ghost) → Incorporeal
- NVD (sick) → Nauseated / SCK (sick) → Sickened
- SHK/FRI/PAN (exclamation marks) → Shaken/Frightened/Panicked
- E-1…E-n (down arrow with level) → Energy Drained
Full text for tooltips is drawn from SRD references above.

Badge priority rules:
- Fatal/KO first (Dead > Dying > Unconscious > Stable/Disabled > Staggered)
- Mobility impairments next (Paralyzed, Prone, Grappled/Entangled)
- Defense/surprise (Flat-Footed, Invisible, Incorporeal)
- Debuffs (Stunned, Dazed, Sickened, Nauseated, Fatigued/Exhausted)
- Fear states (Panicked > Frightened > Shaken)
- Metaconditions (Energy Drained)

8) Engine integration adapters
- Translate your character engine’s data model to CharacterStatus and events.
- Throttling/debouncing for frequent HP ticks or buff timers.
- One-liners to emit SRD-consistent system text (e.g., “X is now Prone.”) on condition changes.

9) Persistence and options
- UI settings (scale, text speed, color theme, show HP detailed/compact).
- Windowed/fullscreen, integer scaling lock, CRT-scanline optional shader.

10) Accessibility
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast for UI text.
- Dyslexia-friendly option: switch monospace to OpenDyslexic bitmap variant (still retro).
- Colorblind-safe palette for HP and status (use icons + color).

11) Skinning/theming
- External JSON or YAML:
  - palette, border image paths (9-slice), font atlas name, icon atlas name.
  - Layout paddings/margins per region.

12) Testing and QA
- Snapshot tests for each component with representative party states.
- Event-sequence tests: “ambush → conditions applied → log prompts → flee.”
- Hotkey map tests and focus handling (no lost input during prompts).
- Performance: ensure <1 ms per frame render for UI at 320×200 baseline (before scaling).

## example data shapes

PartyUpdate
{
  party: CharacterStatus[],
  activeIndex?: number
}

Message
{
  id: string
  text: string
  kind: "Narration"|"Combat"|"System"|"Skill"|"Warning"|"Prompt"
  requiresAck?: boolean
  color?: string
  timestamp?: number
}

ViewportScene
{
  mode: "image"|"tile"|"overlay"
  imageId?: string
  tileRendererId?: string
  overlay?: { imageId: string; x: number; y: number }
}

## command semantics (engine-side)
- Advance(): try step forward; if blocked, pushMessage(“You can’t go that way.”)
- Wait(): advance time N segments; resolve random encounters/regen.
- Flee(): in combat, attempt to exit per SRD; in exploration, backstep + chance of pursuit.
- Combat(): spawn encounter; swap to combat command set.
- Contextual commands become available based on triggers (door, NPC, searchable area).

## message and prompt patterns (SRD-friendly)
- On condition application: “[Name] is [Condition].”
- On stabilization: “[Name] stabilizes.”
- On death: “[Name] dies.”
- Skill check: “Search +6 vs DC 15 → 19 (success). You find …”
- Prompt format:
  - “You are in a building full of records. Do you wish to spend hours reading the records?” [Y]ES [N]O

## asset checklist
- Fonts: retro monospace normal/bold; atlas PNG + .fnt file.
- Borders: 9-slice frames for viewport, panel, log (light and dark variants).
- Icons: ~22 glyphs for conditions, + targeting arrow, active-turn chevron.
- Viewport art: town street, hallway, wilderness, interiors, event vignettes.

## minimal implementation order (sprints)

Sprint 1 — Skeleton and state
- Frame layout and scaling
- MessageLog with color and paging
- PartyPanel rows with HP/AC and simple badges
- CommandBar with hotkeys and enable/disable

Sprint 2 — Conditions and tooltips
- Condition code map + priority + icons
- Tooltips on badges with SRD text snippets
- Engine event adapters for status/HP/AC

Sprint 3 — Viewport and movement
- Image scene mode and simple “advance” animation
- Location/time line (11,0 S 00:28-style) under viewport

Sprint 4 — Prompts and interactions
- Prompt API + blocking input handling
- Contextual commands (Talk/Use/Search)

Sprint 5 — Theming and options
- Theme JSON + palette swap
- Options overlay; persist to file

Sprint 6 — QA polish
- Snapshot tests, hotkey tests, perf pass
- Scrollback overlay + search

## acceptance criteria (per module)
- PartyPanel: correctly shows 6 members; HP colors change at thresholds; changing any state triggers a 1-frame update; badge overflow shows “+n” and tooltip lists all.
- MessageLog: preserves order; [MORE] appears when overflow; SPACE/ENTER advances; scrollback opens and closes without input leaks.
- CommandBar: only valid actions enabled; hotkeys respond even if mouse hovered elsewhere.
- Viewport: swapping scenes is flicker-free; advance anim plays; cut-in overlay composes over scene.
- Conditions: applying SRD-listed conditions shows correct badge, priority, and tooltip text; removal updates immediately.

## risks and mitigations
- Overcrowded party rows: use short codes + tooltips; allow detailed HP toggle; collapse long names with ellipsis.
- Readability at high DPI: enforce integer scaling; optional 2× font mode.
- Input race between prompts and movement: centralize an InputMode (explore/combat/prompt).

## integration checklist with an existing character engine
- Implement a thin adapter to publish engine events to UI Store.
- Map engine’s status flags to ConditionCode enum.
- Emit MessageLog entries on key transitions (KO, stabilization, death, rest, level drain).
- Provide images/scene IDs for exploration nodes to the Viewport.

## done-for-you SRD condition enum (names to display/codes)
- AbilityDamaged (ABD), AbilityDrained (ADR) [tooltip only; usually no badge]
- Blinded (BLD), Deafened (DEF)
- Dazed (DAZ), Dazzled (DZZ), Stunned (STUN), Confused (CNF), Fascinated (FAS)
- Fatigued (FAT), Exhausted (EXH)
- FlatFooted (FTF)
- Frightened (FRI), Shaken (SHK), Panicked (PAN), Cowering (COW)
- Grappling (GRP), Pinned (PIN)
- Entangled (ENT), Paralyzed (PAR), Petrified (PET), Prone (PRN), KnockedDown (KDN)
- Nauseated (NVD), Sickened (SCK)
- Invisible (INV), Incorporeal (INC)
- EnergyDrained (ENx, with level count), Turned (TRN)
- Disabled (DIS), Dying (DYG), Stable (STBL), Unconscious (UNC), Dead (DEAD)

Reference text for each comes from the SRD links above.

## minimal data/asset files to add
- config/theme.json (palette, frames, font, icon atlas)
- icons/conditions.png (+ meta .json for sprite coords)
- fonts/retro8x8.png + retro8x8.fnt
- scenes/… (starter images)

## developer notes
- Keep public API narrow: UI consumes only the store, and emits only defined commands.
- Favor immediate-mode drawing or simple retained elements; no heavy UI framework needed.
- For mouse support, treat labels as button hitboxes; maintain keyboard-first UX fidelity.
